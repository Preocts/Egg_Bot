## Customizable Discord Chat Bot
What started as a simple way to send a welcome message when a new user joined a guild, Egg Bot has expanded to include:

- Definable greetings, both DM and chat, for new user joins
- A custom, regex driven, alert system that watches for mentions of your choice called ShoulderBird
- Highly definable permission based chat commands
 - Control by Guild, Channels, Roles, and Users
 - more features in the works
