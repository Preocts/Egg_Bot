Change log 0.2.3
- Formatting changes.
- on_member_join updated to use the proper DM and Chat calls
    + It was previously using its' own call, how arrogant
    + Also removed image support - this was only half-baked at best
- Removed check for empty guildname input for command methods. We're using an empty guild for DM Commands
- ShoulderBird method created: toggleBird {username}
- ShoulderBird specific commands created:
    + sb_toggle : Toggle ShoulderBird on and off
    + sb_set {guildname} = {regEx}: Replace existing (or create) regEx ShoulderBird search
    + sb_show : Output current regEx ShoulderBird search for all guilds
    + sb_delete {guildname} : Delete search from provided guild

Change log 0.2.2
- tore apart (refactored) on_message
    + Shoulder Bird gets its own def
    + Commands go to their own def
    + Chat messages and DM message breifly had their own def
    + Handles Chat and DM messages differently
- "botCommands" section added to json config
    + botCommands{} -> GuildName{} -> CommandName{} -> CommandConfigs{}
- created handler_ChatMessage and handler_DMMessage
- deleted handler_ChatMessage and handler_DMMessage
- Questioned my sanity
- Class addtions
    + botCommands dict
    + listCommand(GuildName) - returns list of command names set in Guild
    + getCommand(GuildName, CommandName) - returns dict of specific command
    + putCommand(GuildName, FullChatLine)
        - sets command, does all the parsing needed (send discord.py message.content)
        - will override existing commands - allows for update/editing easier
        - e!command [commandname] < | option = option value | option2 = option2 value >
    + delCommand(GuildName, CommandName) - deletes given command
- TWO MONTHS LATER
- Completely refactored on_message def, again.  This time it's solid (er)
    - Missing shoulder bird call
- Command actions defined:
    + 'edit-command' : used for create/edit of commands
    + 'show-command' : used to return the same string used to config a command
    + 'delete-command' : used to delete a command from the guild/DM
    + 'list-command' : used to return a list of all commands in guild/DM
- Class updates:
    + 'getBird' : returns a specifc user's ShoulderBird search
    + 'getBirds' : returns a guild's dict of ShoulderBird searches
    + 'putBird' : create/update a user's search (adds guild if missing)
    + 'delBird' : deletes a user's entry.  Why would you do this?
- Command permissions (users/channels/roles) now work
- No way to remove a permission once set, this will be backlogged
    + Work-around now is to delete the command and recreate it
- Command have no guardrails. You can delete the only command allowing edits/creates
